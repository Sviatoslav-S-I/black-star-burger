            <h2>Let's Start</h2>
            <p>The restaurant has its history since September 16, 2016. The institution was opened by businessman Yuri Levitas together with Timati, Pavel Kuryanov and Walter. The partners visited thousands of burger houses all over the world, tried to take into account mistakes and draw on the positive experience of each of them and bring all the experience gained into a restaurant that spilled over into a new wave of the burger revolution called Black Star Burger.</p>
            <h2>About Burgers</h2>
            <p>The burger revolution in Russia has come about long ago. It would seem that one might think that the train left, but Black Star Burger managed to drop into the last car of the departing train, change its direction and become a locomotive. We cook burgers because, contrary to popular belief, burgers are not a junk food, it is a complex sandwich that can be satiated with benefits by eating fewer calories than, for example, eating a complex lunch.</p>
            <h2>About Quality</h2>
            <p>Everything is exceptionally fresh at us, no preparations: everything that is cooked today, today will certainly be consumed. Our suppliers are leaders in the Russian market in their segment. We prepare burgers from marbled beef grass and grain fattening Aberdeen-Angus breed grown without hormones and antibiotics. 100% naturalness and quality is guaranteed by the Zarechnoye Group of Companies, which supplies for us minced meat from marbled beef under the Primbiff brand. Every day we bake in 2 types of golden burger rolls. The unique author's recipe allows you to make them home - fragrant and soft. Our main know-how in the unique composition and system of frying cutlets. We make a blend of different cuts of marbled beef. Before frying, cutlets must be strictly 170 grams by weight and a diameter of 17 centimeters.</p>
            <h2>What Special?</h2>
            <p>We are the first to bring black-burgers to fashion. Since the opening of the Black Star Burger, thousands of establishments across the country have taken this path. We have an original serving of dishes. Before buying sharp wings “On weak”, the guest must fill out a receipt that he has no complaints about the institution. When serving the wings, all employees of the open kitchen after two beats in the bell chant - "On weak." When ordering Mega- and VIP-burgers, the waiter makes an order for the guest, all this is accompanied by 5 beats in the bell and fireworks.</p>
            <h2>About Price Policy</h2>
            <p>Our prices are beyond competition. Thanks to friendship with our partners, the best and largest suppliers in the country, we purchase products at the lowest prices. By adding truffle oil, foie gras and delicious sauces to our dishes, we can afford not to increase the cost of the final product so that as many people with different incomes as possible try our masterpieces.</p>
            <h2>ABOUT COMPETITORS</h2>
            <p>Initially, we wanted to compete with large fast food players. But to take a catch-up position, to repeat existing formats, is not about us. Therefore, we have created a restaurant of a new formation, in which they cook deliciously, efficiently and quickly. We compare ourselves in quality with the world level burger leaders: Umami, Gordon Ramsey, and in price policy we are very democratically on a par with McDonald’s. We are improving daily, introducing various know-how. This also applies to paraphernalia - black gloves, and cooking technologies - a unique way of roasting, which makes it possible to cook the most juicy cutlet in the world. We also have a completely new strategy for building the technological chain. Many can cook tasty, but inexpensively, quickly, and even in such quantities - not everyone, because this is a whole art. To make 4000 first-class burgers a day is only for us to do.</p>
            <h2>About PR</h2>
            <p>We are a folk, absolutely transparent restaurant. A huge number of people follow us on Instagram and other social networks every day. It is believed that the Black Star Burger spins an army of marketers. This is nothing more than a myth. We promote our restaurant with word of mouth, with the help of social networks, with the help of our reputation, namely, reaction to reviews. People feel our transparency, trust us. This is also our know-how; there is no such interactive restaurant in the world anymore.</p>
            <h2>ABOUT STEREOTYPES</h2>
            <p>We have expanded our target audience as much as possible. Here you can meet the oligarch and a simple student sitting side by side. Any Russian can dine at Black Star Burger. For a well-off audience, we are attractive for its high quality, for a student - also for affordable prices. We break the stereotype that the burger is harmful. We have everything natural, we are preferred by athletes and people who monitor their health.</p>
            <h2>And Last...</h2>
            <p>We would like our potential consumer not to compare us with anyone. We are really different. We are innovators. Yes, we are interested in profit, but the main thing is in another. It may sound romantic, but we want a culinary revolution, we want to break stereotypes and surprise. We hope we do it.</p>
